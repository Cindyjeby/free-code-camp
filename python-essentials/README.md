Hello Friends

This folder contains my learning journey on python.
I used materials from cisco networking academy, and lots of youtube videos mainly Free code camp.

rock-paper-scissors
in this file we lean how to create variables and strings and call functions.

we first create  a function: this is a set of code that only works when called.
a function starts with def and ends with a colon.
 
Then we assign to the function variable called player_choice then assign a string rock
strings can either be in single or double qoutes
